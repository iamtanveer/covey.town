### User Story 1 - Chat with everyone in the same town

This user story allows the users to communicate with other users in the same Covey Town using the Broadcast Chat functionality. The steps to use this feature are:

1. After joining a town, the user will see the Chat area on the right side of the screen. There is a drop-down on the top-right hand side showing the current chat type selected. By default, it will be ‘Broadcast Chat’.
2. To enter a message, the user needs to type in a message in the input box which says ‘Enter Message’.

4. The other user (Tanveer in the image below) can see that the select player drop-down now shows a number in front of the user's name. Earlier it was 0 since no message was sent but after getting a message, it changes to notify the user about the number of messages from other user. In the image below, Tanveer can see that Saurabh has sent them a private message which can be viewed by clicking on the user's name from the drop-down.

5. After clicking on the user's name from the drop-down, the receiver is shown the message that was sent. (in the image below, Tanveer can see the message from Saurabh, in the chat area)
